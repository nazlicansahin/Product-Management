### Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## Technologies Used

- Next.js: A React framework for building server-rendered applications.
- MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing and managing product data.
- NodeJS: a single-threaded, open-source, cross-platform runtime environment for building fast and scalable server-side and networking applications.
- React: React is a library allows developers to create large web applications that can change data, without reloading the page.

## Future Enhancements

# What I learned

This is a fullstack task but I am not (just planning to be ðŸ˜…) also my first contact with the backend, so good for me ðŸŽ‰

   - I leraned best pratices of placing files in directory
   - I learned how to use Postman to testing my http request
   - I learned usage of MongoDb and implementation to project
   - I learned writing basic endpoints
   - I gained experience using tailwind
   - I learned how websites works (bakcand sides)


# What I could not learn and I should learn
- I should learn bring together both process below

- **Admin Dashboard:** Log in to an admin dashboard where you can manage products, add new items, and update existing information.

- **User Authentication:** Secure user authentication using Next.js authentication libraries, ensuring authorized access to the admin features.

- **Access token usage at database**
